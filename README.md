# 👋 Hi, I'm Rin Steitz!

I'm a PhD candidate in **Computational Linguistics** at Indiana University with a minor in Computer Science. My work bridges speech processing, data analysis, natural language understanding, and real-world applications — especially for **low-resource languages** and **clinical contexts** like Parkinson’s disease detection.

My research focuses on:
- 🧪 **Voice-based biomarker detection** (e.g., Parkinson's severity from speech)
- 🗣️ **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** for under-represented and tonal languages
- 🌍 **Multilingual NLP** and syntax-aware models (e.g., Korean, Arabic, Yoruba)
- 💬 **Grammatical Error Correction (GEC)** with T5 and dependency-aware attention
- 🔍 NLP tools for **radicalization discourse analysis** (with NICC, Brussels)

## 📌 Pinned Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm most proud of:

### 🧾 [Speak & Summarize](https://github.com/ensteitz/speak-and-summarize)
Fine-tuned summarization of Whisper-transcribed TED Talks using GPT and T5, comparing zero-shot, role-based, and chain-of-thought prompting strategies.

### 🧠 [Parkinson's Voice Biomarker Detection](https://github.com/ensteitz/parkinson-voice-biomarkers)
Signal processing and machine learning pipeline to classify Parkinson's severity using extracted speech features (e.g., jitter, shimmer, MFCCs).

### 🌐 [MultiGEC 2025 Shared Task](https://github.com/mealieff/gec-645-iunlp)
Grammatical error correction system incorporating dependency relations into the attention mechanism for multilingual grammar correction.

### 🗣️ [Dimasa Speech Recognition](https://github.com/ensteitz/dimasa-asr)
Building an ASR system for the under-resourced Dimasa language using multilingual models and tone-aware evaluation strategies on a the Computational Resource on South Asian Languages (CoRSAL) corpus.
